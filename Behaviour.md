## 1.A type braitenberg vehicle
In this case the robot when gets high ranges from the sonar sensor at right then the right wheel turns faster thus turns away from the object.

## 2.B type braitenberg vehicle
In this case if the readings of range is high in the right sensor then the left wheel turns faster so it moves towards the object.

## 3.C type braitenberg vehicle
In this case if the left readings of ranges is high than right then the robot behaves as B-type and if right range is high then it behaves as A-type other wise both wheel speed are set to same speed so it moves straight.
